                <h3>Games Programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    By now you know my name is Phill and that I enjoy bringing ideas to life through programming, however, it wasn’t always this way...<br> I was once a very busy drone in a large corporation doing important work, but it had become repetitive and mundane.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then one day I woke up and remembered how much fun I had at university learning graphics and games programming and thought “I wish I could do that for a living!”. So I applied to the Academy of Interactive Entertainment to learn how to become a games programmer…
                </p>
                <p>
                    A couple of years later, I have completed my Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development, moved from Canberra to Melbourne and I am having heaps of fun making games and meeting like minded people.
                </p>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy keeping fit and healthy so my body is ready to do the things I want it to, when I ask it to. <br>
                    My preference is for endurance activities which are both mentally and physically challenging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I lived in Canberra, Cycling was my preferred outlet; I trained and raced both mountain and road bike disciplines. <br> If I wasn't at work I was out on one of my bikes training for my next race or just cruising with friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now living in Melbourne running has become my new challenge to master as Melbourne is quite as bike friendly city and Canberra. I have been taking part in ParkRuns and competing in a number of 10km races with pleasing results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rubik's Cubes and Juggling keep my hands busy when they are not busy on a keyboard or with a game controller.
